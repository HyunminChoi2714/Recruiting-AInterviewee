There are elements of value scenarios. Value scenarios draw upon five key elements to develop provocative sketches of the future: stakeholders, pervasiveness, time, systemic effects, and value implications. Stakeholders: Following Value Sensitive Design, value scenarios help designers envision a range of effects of a pervasive technology, both on those who are in direct contact with a technology (direct stakeholders), and on those who might not be direct users, but whose lives are affected by various interactions around the technology (indirect stakeholders). Pervasiveness: A value scenario presents a vision in which a technology has become widespread, spanning various geographic regions, cultures, social classes, and other contexts (e.g. school, work, home, car). Time: Rather than focus on short-term effects, value scenarios take into consideration what the world might look like five, ten, or twenty years after a technology has been deployed. Systemic Effects: Value scenarios explore the multi-dimensional interactions among technology, psychology, society, culture, and the environment as use of the technology becomes pervasive over a period of years. Value Implications: Finally, drawing on Value Sensitive Design and aspects of design noir, value scenarios help envision not only positive effects of technology, but also its darker consequences. We suggest that a careful consideration of a diverse range of influences, including the negative, should be a key component of the design process.‘‘‘'\n",
